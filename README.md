# Jet Lag: The Game - Hide and Seek Map for Munich

This repository contains a custom Hide & Seek map of Munich for the home game, using the U-Bahn and Tram network.

The map was created using this excellent guide: https://julweb.dev/blog/create-your-own-jetlag-map-with-qgis, which provides clear instructions on how to build your own Jet Lag maps with QGIS.

Feel free to use this map in your own games, adapt it, or take inspiration for creating maps of other cities. I included a version with and without the questions on the side, as well as the .geojson, .qgz and .qpt files, if you want to modify the map in QGIS. The GIMP file (.xcf) is also uploaded, so you can edit the question sidebar or add it to your own maps.
